/**
 *  A common abstraction for a service to load a large volume of related data.
 *  This is deliberately simplified from Tinkerpop's Blueprint's APIs with no 
 *  requirements for indexing properties or application control over transaction scope.
 *  
 *  The challenge is simply to demonstrate loading a large amount of linked data into a 
 *  graph database as a simple stress test of dealing with a large volume of data.
 *  
 *  Implementations need not offer any guarantees over transactional integrity other than
 *  when close() is called successfully all content is safely on the disk. A process death at
 *  any other time does not have to offer any guarantees over database integrity.
 *
